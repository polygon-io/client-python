# Pattern for Non-Blocking WebSocket and REST Calls in Python

This script demonstrates a non-blocking pattern for handling WebSocket streams and REST API calls in Python using asyncio. It focuses on efficient, concurrent processing of real-time financial data and asynchronous fetching of additional information, ensuring that real-time data streams are managed without delays or blockages. The tutorial provides both theoretical insights and a practical, adaptable example, ideal for applications in financial data processing and similar real-time data handling scenarios.
